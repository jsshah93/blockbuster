# blockbuster

find my screenshots for the following in the main branch;
Postman (post/get/put/delete) 
Testing (test coverage & JUnit) 
ERD 
Risk assessment 


Why are we doing this? 
- I am making this project to show what i have learned in the bootcamp eg. the CRUD functionality, JUnit and mockito testing in java.  

How I expected the challenge to go.
- i expected to find the challange alot more difficult than i did this was helped with a supporting trainer ready to guide me to find the answer whether that was on qa community or somewhere else such as stack overflow.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
- i found setting up for the project to be easy such as the jira board, setting up github repo and so on. i have abit of dificulty with the coding itself as the bootcamp was completed months ago and i have now had the time to actually complete the project. the testing didnt go too well to start with but with some guidence and tweeks i am happy with the testing coverage i got. 

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
- my aim was to make a simple programe which i have, i would for future revision of the project look to make it more complex and feature rich.  

Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
- i have included these in the main branch under the names of (post/get/put/delete)

Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
- i have included a mysql data screenshot in the main branch showing my database, also showing is the data and looking at the postman screenshots you can see i created and deleted records which is why the database shows records 3 & 5 only. 

Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
- I have screenshots in the main branch names JUnit and Test coverage showing both.  

Link to Jira Board - You must add your trainer(s) as collaborators also.
